# Coding challenge

## Task requirements:
- You should use TypeScript or another strongly typed programming language
- You must use a frontend framework (e.g. Vue.js, React, Svelte).
- You must style your application, either using a CSS framework (e.g. Bootstrap, Tailwind) or your own styles. It doesn’t need to be the most elaborately designed application, but the user interface should be clean and easy to use.
- You must use Git version control, you can use this to show how your solution
developed but don’t worry too much about making lots of commits.
- You should spend about an hour (not including the time to read this!), you
don’t need to have finished everything
- Send the response as a ZIP file of the whole project directory

## Getting started:
To speed things up you can use a starter template to bootstrap your application. We provide a starter template which bootstraps Vue 3, TypeScript and Tailwind, but you could also choose to use your own.

We highly recommend using a starter template so you don’t have to spend too long setting up the project. If you don’t use a starter template, you shouldn’t include the environment setup time in the challenge time. Please get in touch if you have any concerns.

Either way, please create one Git commit directly after you have set up the initial application so it’s easier for us to see your specific challenge related changes.

## The challenge
You are tasked with creating a classic to-do list application. The user needs to be able to add, edit and delete tasks from their to-do list as well as see an overview of how many tasks they have completed.

The product requirements are:
- [ ] A task has a description, creation date and a status of either outstanding or completed
- [ ] A user should be able to clearly see if a task is outstanding or completed
- [ ] A user should be able to see the date and time when they created the task
- [ ] A user can create a task with just a description, tasks are marked as outstanding when created
- [ ] An outstanding task can be marked as completed
- [ ] An outstanding task’s description can be edited
- [ ] A completed task can be marked as outstanding
- [ ] A completed task cannot be edited
- [ ] Both outstanding and completed tasks can be deleted
- [ ] There must be a summary at the bottom of the list showing how many tasks are outstanding and completed
